We use visualisation techniques in order to find patterns behind deforestation and it&amp;rsquo;s driving factors. Following this, we attempt to answer questions regarding conversion of forests to land for other purposes and questions regarding Brazil&amp;rsquo;s excessive loss of forest cover. Then we aim to develop a dashboard to explore the above posed questions.
